# Internship-work ( Flutter App Development)
I did the fron-end work of a flutter app named 'The Step's Art' when I was working as a mobile app development intern in DataSoft. This app will be used for buying and selling artwork. Since I cannot make the code of their commercial app public, I am keeping the images of the frontend part which was coded by me.
